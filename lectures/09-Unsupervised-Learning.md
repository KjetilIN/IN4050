# Lecture 22.oct - Unsupervised Learning 

Supervised learning: learn mapping between label and data
Unsupervised learning: learn the distribution of data

- There is no truth
- Result open to interpretation 

We are given the easy to measure feature. 
Why would be want to do this?
- Being able separate between two objects

For example, with a single feature, we might see that there are two groups. 
In 2D, (two features), we get groupings on the plane, also known as clusters.
- Very useful to represent data in 2D, by doing dimension reduction 

We could have a large number for features for the data as well. 
- Can be plotted by using features y axis, samples on x axis and color code features 

Evaluating the performance:
- No "truth" to compare with
- Performance more to interpretation
- Often we can still implement a loss function to determine which of two solutions is best

## How to generate similar data?
## How many groups are present?
## How to compress the data?
## How to visualize the data in low dimension?
