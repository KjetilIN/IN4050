# Notes
- Make flashcards from the start
- Turing test is a three way communication between examination, machine and person 


## Math crash course
- Line: two points
- Plane: two dimension
- Hyperplane: a lot of dimensions 

Feature vector: a set of numbers that explain a feature for each entry. 

Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance is the most used. 
- Euclidean is the shortest path. 
- Manhattan is the real distance. 

Cosine similarity
Cosine distance
Norm of a vector => length 

Tensor -> three dimension (set of matrixes)

Derivatives is useful for optimization 
Partial derivatives is derivative with respect to a specific variable
